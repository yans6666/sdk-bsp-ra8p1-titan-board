# WDT Usage Instructions

**English** | [**Chinese**](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction

The Watchdog Timer (WDT) ensures that our code runs as expected and can effectively prevent the program from “running away” due to uncontrollable factors.
 This example demonstrates how to use the **WDT module of the RA8 series MCU** on the **Titan Board**, together with the **RT-Thread WDT driver framework**, to implement watchdog functionality, including timer configuration, feeding the watchdog, and handling timeouts.

## WDT (Watchdog Timer) Instruction

### 1. General Description

The **WDT (Watchdog Timer)** is a **hardware timer used in embedded systems to monitor system operation and prevent the program from hanging or stalling**.

If the MCU or processor does not reset (Kick/Reload) the WDT within the specified period, the WDT will **automatically reset the system**, ensuring it can resume normal operation.

Typical use cases for WDT:

- Preventing software infinite loops or task stalls
- Improving system reliability and stability
- Critical applications such as industrial control, automotive electronics, drones, and communication devices

### 2. Working Principle

1. **Counter Mode**
   - The WDT includes a decrementing counter that starts from an initial value.
   - The MCU must **reset the counter (Reload/Kick)** before it reaches zero.
   - If the counter reaches zero, a **system reset** or **interrupt** is triggered.
2. **Feeding the Watchdog**
   - The MCU periodically writes a specific value to reset the counter.
   - Commonly called “feeding the dog,” this ensures that during normal operation, the WDT does not reset the system.
3. **Reset/Interrupt Mode**
   - **Reset Mode**: The WDT expiration directly resets the MCU.
   - **Interrupt Mode**: The WDT expiration generates an interrupt, allowing software to attempt recovery first.

### 3. Types of WDT

| Type                       | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Independent WDT (IWDT)** | Has its own clock source; continues running during reset or suspend |
| **Window WDT (WWDT)**      | Requires feeding within a specific time window               |
| **Super WDT**              | Offers higher precision or longer configurable periods       |
| **Software WDT**           | Implemented via software timers, maintained by OS or applications |

### 4. Key Parameters

- **Counter width**: Determines maximum timeout period
- **Timeout**: Time from last feed to system reset trigger
- **Clock source**: Independent low-speed oscillator or system clock
- **Reset method**: Hardware reset or interrupt notification

Example:

- WDT timeout = 500 ms
- MCU feeds the WDT every 100 ms
- If the MCU stalls and fails to feed the WDT for 500 ms → WDT resets the system

### 5. Usage Guidelines

1. **Feed periodically**: Ensure WDT is refreshed during normal operation.
2. **Feed in critical tasks**: Typically in the main loop or key tasks.
3. **Interrupt-safe**: Feeding should not be blocked by interrupts.
4. **Reasonable timeout**: Must be longer than task execution time but not excessively long.

## RA8 Series WDT Module (r_wdt) Instruction

The RA8 MCU series integrates a high-performance **WDT module (r_wdt)**, providing reliable system monitoring with support for both reset and interrupt modes.

### 1. Key Features

- **Timer mode**: Single-shot or periodic
- **Clock sources**: Low-power oscillator (LPO) or system clock
- **Reset and interrupt outputs**:
  - Timeout can reset the MCU
  - Interrupt mode available for software recovery
- **Counter range**: 8–32 bits, configurable timeout period
- **Safety features**:
  - Protection against unintended writes (unlock sequences required)
  - Multi-level reset modes (WDT reset, NMI reset)
- **Independent operation**: Runs even in low-power or sleep mode

### 2. Module Architecture

The RA8 WDT module contains:

1. **Counter Unit** – decrements with clock input, detects overflow
2. **Control Registers** – configure timeout, mode, and feeding sequence
3. **Status Registers** – indicate WDT state, timeout flags, interrupt/reset flags
4. **Reset & Interrupt Unit** – triggers MCU reset or interrupt/NMI upon timeout

### 3. Working Flow

1. **Start WDT**: Configure clock source, counter, and timeout period, then enable.
2. **Feed operation**: Software writes the specific sequence to reset the counter.
3. **Timeout event**: If feeding is missed → counter overflows:
   - Triggers MCU reset (reset mode)
   - Triggers interrupt (interrupt mode)
4. **Safety protection**: Registers require unlock before modification.

## RT-Thread WDT Framework Instruction

**RT-Thread WDT (Watchdog Timer) Framework** is a unified interface provided by the RT-Thread device driver layer for managing hardware watchdog modules across different MCUs.
 This framework abstracts the hardware WDT functionality into a standardized device interface, allowing applications to use a consistent API across platforms to implement system self-recovery mechanisms.

### 1. Device Model

In RT-Thread, the WDT is managed as a **device object** (a subclass of `struct rt_device`, with type `RT_Device_Class_WDT`).
 Developers don’t need to deal with low-level hardware register operations — all watchdog functionalities can be implemented through the standard RT-Thread device interfaces.

### 2. Operation Interfaces

Applications access the watchdog hardware using RT-Thread’s I/O device management interfaces as shown below:

- **Find the Watchdog Device**

```c
rt_device_t rt_device_find(const char* name);
```

- **Initialize the Watchdog**

```c
rt_err_t rt_device_init(rt_device_t dev);
```

- **Control the Watchdog**

```c
rt_err_t rt_device_control(rt_device_t dev, rt_uint8_t cmd, void* arg);
```

Available watchdog control commands are defined as follows:

```c
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_GET_TIMEOUT    (1) /* Get the timeout period */
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_SET_TIMEOUT    (2) /* Set the timeout period */
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_GET_TIMELEFT   (3) /* Get the remaining time before reset */
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_KEEPALIVE      (4) /* Feed the watchdog */
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_START          (5) /* Start the watchdog */
#define RT_DEVICE_CTRL_WDT_STOP           (6) /* Stop the watchdog */
```

- **Close the Watchdog Device**

```c
rt_err_t rt_device_close(rt_device_t dev);
```

### 3. Framework Features

- **Unified Device Abstraction**: All hardware WDTs are exposed to upper layers through the same device interface.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Applications can be ported across MCU platforms without changing WDT-related code.
- **Timeout Protection**: Supports configurable timeout periods; if the system fails to feed the watchdog, it triggers an interrupt or reset.
- **Flexible Operating Modes**: Supports both **interrupt mode** and **reset mode** to meet various application requirements.
- **High Reliability**: Ensures system safety by using hardware-enforced reset mechanisms to recover from system hangs.

## Compilation & Download

* **RT-Thread Studio**: Download the Titan Board resource package in the RT-Thread Studio package manager, then create a new project and compile it.

After compilation, connect the USB-DBG interface of the development board to the PC, and download the firmware to the development board.

## Run Effects

Enter the `wdt_sample` command at the terminal to run the WDT test program. After feeding the dog 10 times, stop feeding the dog to simulate an abnormal program situation.
