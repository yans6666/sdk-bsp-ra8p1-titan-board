# BMI088 Gyroscope Usage Instructions

**English** | [**Chinese**](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use the **SPI module of the RA8 series MCU** on the **Titan Board**, in combination with the **RT-Thread SPI driver framework** and the **BMI088 software package (a 6-axis IMU: 3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope)**, to perform sensor initialization and data acquisition.

## Overview of BMI088

### 1. General Description

The **BMI088** is a **high-performance 6-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** developed by Bosch Sensortec, integrating a **3-axis accelerometer** and a **3-axis gyroscope**.

It is designed for **drones, robotics, industrial automation, and navigation systems**, where high stability and low noise are required.

The BMI088 is well known for its **high vibration robustness** and **low noise performance**. Compared with common consumer-grade IMUs (such as MPU6050, BMI160, etc.), it is more widely used in industrial and UAV applications.

## RA8 Series SPI Module (r_spi_b) Instructions

The RA8 series MCU integrates an **enhanced SPI module (r_spi_b)**, which can be used for high-speed serial communication with peripherals such as Flash memory, sensors, displays, and audio codecs. This module supports both master and slave modes, provides full-duplex communication, and integrates rich buffering, clock control, and DMA mechanisms at the hardware level, effectively reducing CPU workload.

### 1. Key Features

- **Operating Modes**
  - Supports **Master mode** and **Slave mode**
  - Supports **Full-duplex communication** (simultaneous transmit and receive)
  - Supports **Half-duplex mode** for unidirectional communication devices
- **Clock Features**
  - Supports serial clock (SPCLK) up to **166 MHz** (depending on system clock and device specifications)
  - Configurable **polarity (CPOL)** and **phase (CPHA)**, supporting standard **SPI Modes 0/1/2/3**
- **Data Format**
  - Supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit frame formats
  - Supports **MSB-first** and **LSB-first** transmission
- **Chip Select Management**
  - Supports **hardware chip select (SSL0~SSL3)**
  - Also supports **software-controlled GPIO chip select**
- **Buffering & DMA**
  - Built-in **FIFO buffers** to reduce interrupt frequency
  - Supports **DTC/DMA** automatic transfer, ideal for large data transactions
- **Interrupts & Events**
  - Transmit complete interrupt
  - Receive complete interrupt
  - Transfer error interrupt (e.g., overflow, underrun)

### 2. SPI Module Architecture

The RA8 series SPI (r_spi_b) consists of the following submodules:

1. **Clock Control Unit**
   - Generates the serial clock (SPCLK)
   - Configurable prescalers for adjusting communication speed
   - Provides polarity (CPOL) and phase (CPHA) settings
2. **Transfer Control Unit**
   - Controls data frame length (8/16/32-bit)
   - Configures data order (MSB/LSB)
   - Manages transmit/receive direction
3. **FIFO Buffers**
   - Transmit FIFO
   - Receive FIFO
   - Reduce interrupt frequency, improve performance
4. **Chip Select Control Unit**
   - Provides up to 4 independent chip select signals (SSL0~SSL3)
   - Automatic assertion/deassertion of chip select
   - Supports multiple slave devices
5. **DMA/DTC Support**
   - SPI module can directly cooperate with DMA/DTC
   - Enables **CPU-free streaming data transfer**
   - Especially useful for sensor data acquisition, external memory access, etc.
6. **Interrupt Control**
   - Transmit interrupt (TXI)
   - Receive interrupt (RXI)
   - Transfer end interrupt (TEI)
   - Error interrupt (ERI)

### 3. Working Principle

1. **Master Mode Communication**
   - Configure SPCLK, CPOL, and CPHA
   - Configure chip select signal (SSLx)
   - Write data into transmit FIFO
   - SPI hardware automatically shifts out data while receiving incoming data
2. **Slave Mode Communication**
   - Wait for chip select signal from master
   - Receive data from master while optionally transmitting response data
   - Supports DMA for writing received data into memory
3. **FIFO & DMA Coordination**
   - Short transfers: handled via interrupts
   - Large data transfers: automatically handled via DMA/DTC, CPU only needs to configure initial parameters

## RT-Thread SPI Driver Framework

**The RT-Thread SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) framework** is a unified interface provided by the RT-Thread device driver layer to manage SPI peripherals across different MCUs. It abstracts low-level hardware register operations, allowing applications to communicate with SPI slave devices via standardized APIs in an efficient, reliable, and portable way.

### 1. Device Model

In RT-Thread, the SPI system consists of **buses** and **devices**. SPI devices are managed as **device objects** (subclass of `struct rt_device`, type `RT_Device_Class_SPIBUS` or `RT_Device_Class_SPIDevice`). Developers do not need to access hardware registers directly — all send, receive, and chip-select operations can be performed through standard RT-Thread SPI APIs.

### 2. Operation Interfaces

Applications interact with SPI devices through RT-Thread’s device management interfaces. Common APIs include:

- Find SPI device

```c
rt_device_t rt_device_find(const char* name);
```

- Custom message transfer

```c
struct rt_spi_message *rt_spi_transfer_message(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                                               struct rt_spi_message *message);
```

This function allows transferring a sequence of messages.
 Users can define multiple `message` structures to precisely control chip-select behavior and transfer sequence.
 The `struct rt_spi_message` is defined as follows:

```c
struct rt_spi_message
{
    const void *send_buf;           /* Send buffer pointer */
    void *recv_buf;                 /* Receive buffer pointer */
    rt_size_t length;               /* Number of bytes to transfer */
    struct rt_spi_message *next;    /* Pointer to next message */
    unsigned cs_take    : 1;        /* Chip select active */
    unsigned cs_release : 1;        /* Chip select release */
};
```

- Transfer a single block of data

```c
rt_size_t rt_spi_transfer(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                          const void           *send_buf,
                          void                 *recv_buf,
                          rt_size_t             length);
```

- Send-only transfer (ignore received data)

```c
rt_size_t rt_spi_send(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                      const void           *send_buf,
                      rt_size_t             length);
```

- Receive-only transfer

```c
rt_size_t rt_spi_recv(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                      void                 *recv_buf,
                      rt_size_t             length);
```

- Send two buffers continuously (without releasing chip select)

```c
rt_err_t rt_spi_send_then_send(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                               const void           *send_buf1,
                               rt_size_t             send_length1,
                               const void           *send_buf2,
                               rt_size_t             send_length2);
```

- Send then receive data (without releasing chip select)

```c
rt_err_t rt_spi_send_then_recv(struct rt_spi_device *device,
                               const void           *send_buf,
                               rt_size_t             send_length,
                               void                 *recv_buf,
                               rt_size_t             recv_length);
```

### 3. Framework Features

- **Unified abstraction**: Supports both master and slave communication through standard APIs.
- **Cross-platform**: Portable across different MCU platforms with no code changes.
- **Flexible chip-select control**: Supports single, continuous, and combined transfer modes.
- **Message chaining**: Enables complex multi-message transfers via `rt_spi_message`.
- **High extensibility**: Easily integrates with DMA or RT-Thread IPC mechanisms for better performance.
