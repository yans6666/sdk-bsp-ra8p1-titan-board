# RTC and Alarm Example Usage Instructions

**English**|[**Chinese**](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use the **RTC module of RA8 series MCU** on the **Titan Board**, combined with the **RT-Thread RTC driver framework**, to implement basic real-time clock functions and alarm features. The RTC provides accurate real-time information, including year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. Most RTC chips use high-precision crystal oscillators as clock sources. Some chips are equipped with a battery to maintain time even when the main power is off.

The RTC device in RT-Thread provides fundamental time services for the operating system. In increasingly common IoT scenarios, RTC has become standard, and in applications such as SSL secure transmission, RTC is an essential component.

## RTC (Real-Time Clock) Overview

### 1. Overview

**RTC (Real-Time Clock)** is an electronic module or chip used to **measure and track actual time** (year, month, day, hour, minute, second).

It is usually built into a **microcontroller (MCU)** or exists as a standalone chip, providing **system time**, **timed wake-ups**, and **scheduled event triggers**.

The core feature of an RTC is **low power consumption and long-term stable operation**. Even if the main power is off, the RTC can continue running via a backup power source (battery or supercapacitor).

### 2. Working Principle

An RTC is essentially a **low-power oscillator + counter** system:

1. **Clock Source**
   - Typically uses a **32.768 kHz quartz crystal** (1 Hz = 2^15 cycles)
   - Provides a stable time base
2. **Frequency Division & Counting**
   - Divides the crystal frequency to generate 1 Hz pulses
   - Accumulates counts to generate minutes, hours, days, months, and years
3. **Register Storage**
   - Internal registers store current time, date, and alarm settings
4. **Power Backup**
   - Powered by an internal battery or supercapacitor to maintain time during main power loss

### 3. RTC Types

1. **Internal RTC**
   - Integrated into the MCU
   - Pros: Saves chip count, lower cost
   - Cons: Crystal accuracy affected by PCB layout and temperature
2. **External RTC Chip**
   - Standalone chips, e.g., DS3231, PCF8563
   - Pros: High precision, connects via I²C/SPI
   - Cons: Increases PCB area and cost

## RA8 Series RTC Module Overview

The RA8 MCU series includes a highly flexible **RTC peripheral**, suitable for low-power, high-precision embedded time management.

### 1. General Features

- **Time Management**: Supports seconds, minutes, hours, day, month, year, and weekday
- **Clock Source**:
  - **External low-speed crystal** (usually 32.768 kHz) for high precision
  - **Internal low-speed RC oscillator** for low power, slightly lower precision
- **Alarm**: Supports single and repeating alarms with interrupt generation
- **Timers**: Sub-second timers, periodic wake-up timers
- **Tamper Detection (Optional)**: Detects external tampering via configured pins
- **Low-Power Operation**: RTC continues running in standby or sleep mode to maintain time during main power loss

### 2. RTC Module Architecture

RA8 RTC consists of the following functional modules:

1. **Calendar Counter**
   - Maintains current time and date
   - Supports 24-hour or 12-hour format
   - Automatically handles leap years
2. **Alarm & Compare Unit**
   - Compares current time with preset alarm value
   - Triggers interrupts on match
   - Supports repeating alarms (daily, hourly, etc.)
3. **Clock Source & Divider**
   - Divides external 32.768 kHz or internal RC oscillator to 1 Hz time base
   - Allows trade-off between accuracy and power consumption
4. **Interrupt Controller**
   - Supports alarm, periodic, and overflow interrupts
   - Configurable interrupt mask, enable, and status flags
5. **Tamper & Backup Registers (Optional)**
   - Non-volatile registers store data during power loss
   - Tamper pins can trigger interrupts for security applications

### 3. Key Features

| Feature                     | Description                                         |

### 4. Working Principle

1. **Select Clock Source**: external crystal or internal RC oscillator
2. **Set Time**: write initial date and time to calendar counter
3. **Configure Alarm**: set alarm time and enable interrupt
4. **Interrupt Handling**: MCU responds to alarm or periodic events via RTC interrupt flag
5. **Power Management**: RTC continues counting in low-power mode, ensuring accurate time

## RT-Thread RTC Driver Framework

**The RT-Thread RTC (Real-Time Clock) framework** is a unified interface provided by the RT-Thread device driver layer for managing RTC hardware across various MCUs. It abstracts the underlying RTC hardware into a standardized interface, enabling applications to manage date, time, timestamps, and alarms through a consistent API.

### 1. Device Model

In RT-Thread, RTC is managed as a **device object** (a subclass of `struct rt_device`, type `RT_Device_Class_RTC`). Developers do not need to manipulate hardware registers directly. Time configuration, reading, and alarm control can be achieved using standard interfaces.

### 2. Operation Interfaces

Applications access the RTC through RT-Thread’s I/O device management interfaces. The main APIs are as follows:

- Find RTC device

```c
rt_device_t rt_device_find(const char* name);
```

- Open RTC device

```c
rt_err_t rt_device_open(rt_device_t dev, rt_uint16_t oflags);
```

- Set date

```c
rt_err_t set_date(rt_uint32_t year, rt_uint32_t month, rt_uint32_t day);
```

- Set time

```c
rt_err_t set_time(rt_uint32_t hour, rt_uint32_t minute, rt_uint32_t second);
```

- Get current time

The current timestamp (UTC) can be obtained using the C standard library:

```c
time_t time(time_t *t);
```

### 3. Alarm Feature

The RTC framework supports an **alarm mechanism**, which can be used for timed wakeups, reminders, or periodic tasks.
 Applications can operate alarms using the RT-Thread alarm component interfaces:

- Create alarm

```c
rt_alarm_t rt_alarm_create(rt_alarm_callback_t callback, struct rt_alarm_setup *setup);
```

`rt_alarm_setup` structure definition:

```c
struct rt_alarm_setup
{
    rt_uint32_t flag;                /* alarm flag */
    struct tm wktime;                /* alarm trigger time */
};
```

Alarm modes available:

```c
#define RT_ALARM_ONESHOT       0x000   /* Trigger once */
#define RT_ALARM_DAILY         0x100   /* Trigger daily */
#define RT_ALARM_WEEKLY        0x200   /* Trigger weekly */
#define RT_ALARM_MONTHLY       0x400   /* Trigger monthly */
#define RT_ALARM_YEARLY        0x800   /* Trigger yearly */
#define RT_ALARM_HOUR          0x1000  /* Trigger every hour */
#define RT_ALARM_MINUTE        0x2000  /* Trigger every minute */
#define RT_ALARM_SECOND        0x4000  /* Trigger every second */
```

- Start alarm

```c
rt_err_t rt_alarm_start(rt_alarm_t alarm);
```

- Stop alarm

```c
rt_err_t rt_alarm_stop(rt_alarm_t alarm);
```

- Delete alarm

```c
rt_err_t rt_alarm_delete(rt_alarm_t alarm);
```

- Control alarm

```c
rt_err_t rt_alarm_control(rt_alarm_t alarm, int cmd, void *arg);
```

### 4. Framework Features

- **Unified Interface**: Provides a consistent interface to abstract RTC hardware differences.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Adaptable to various MCU RTC modules with seamless application portability.
- **Alarm Mechanism**: Supports one-shot and periodic alarm modes.
- **System Time Synchronization**: Compatible with POSIX time APIs for timestamp management.
- **Low Power Support**: Enables wake-up from deep sleep and retains time during power loss.

## Hardware Description

The RTC device used in this example relies on the LOCO (Low speed On Chip Oscillator) clock. No other special connections are required.

## FSP Configuration

* Open the FSP configuration tool and select the `configuration.xml` file under the corresponding project directory. Add the RTC Stack:

![image-20250728124756259](figures/image-20250728124756259.png)

* Next, configure the RTC parameters. Set the RTC stack name to `g_rtc`, configure the RTC interrupt callback function to `rtc_callback`, and set the interrupt callback priority:

![image-20250728125146813](figures/image-20250728125146813.png)

## RT-Thread Settings Configuration

* Open RT-Thread Settings and enable the RTC under the hardware options:

![image-20250814164856046](figures/image-20250814164856046.png)

* Next, we configure the RTC. First, we need to enable the RT-Thread RTC device framework and enable the alarm function.

## Example Code Description

The source code for this example is located at `/src/hal_entry.c`。

```c
    rt_err_t ret = RT_EOK;
    time_t now;
    rt_device_t device = RT_NULL;

    device = rt_device_find(RTC_NAME);
    if (!device)
    {
      rt_kprintf("find %s failed!\n", RTC_NAME);
    }

    if(rt_device_open(device, 0) != RT_EOK)
    {
      rt_kprintf("open %s failed!\n", RTC_NAME);
    }

    /* 设置日期 */
    ret = set_date(2025, 8, 1);
    rt_kprintf("set RTC date to 2025-8-1\n");
    if (ret != RT_EOK)
    {
        rt_kprintf("set RTC date failed\n");
    }

    /* 设置时间 */
    ret = set_time(15, 00, 00);
    if (ret != RT_EOK)
    {
        rt_kprintf("set RTC time failed\n");
    }

    /* 延时3秒 */
    rt_thread_mdelay(3000);

    /* 获取时间 */
    get_timestamp(&now);
    rt_kprintf("now: %.*s", 25, ctime(&now));
```

The following code creates an RTC alarm and sets it to trigger in 1 second. Finally, the function is exported to the MSH command line.

```c
void user_alarm_callback(rt_alarm_t alarm, time_t timestamp)
{
    LOG_I("user alarm callback function.");
}

void alarm_sample(void)
{
    rt_device_t dev = rt_device_find("rtc");
    struct rt_alarm_setup setup;
    struct rt_alarm * alarm = RT_NULL;
    static time_t now;
    struct tm p_tm;

    if (alarm != RT_NULL)
        return;

    /* Get the current timestamp and set the alarm to trigger in the next second */
    now = get_timestamp(NULL) + 1;
    gmtime_r(&now,&p_tm);

    setup.flag = RT_ALARM_SECOND;
    setup.wktime.tm_year = p_tm.tm_year;
    setup.wktime.tm_mon = p_tm.tm_mon;
    setup.wktime.tm_mday = p_tm.tm_mday;
    setup.wktime.tm_wday = p_tm.tm_wday;
    setup.wktime.tm_hour = p_tm.tm_hour;
    setup.wktime.tm_min = p_tm.tm_min;
    setup.wktime.tm_sec = p_tm.tm_sec;

    alarm = rt_alarm_create(user_alarm_callback, &setup);
    if(RT_NULL != alarm)
    {
        rt_alarm_start(alarm);
    }
}
/* export msh cmd */
MSH_CMD_EXPORT(alarm_sample,alarm sample);
```

## Compilation & Download

* **RT-Thread Studio**: In RT-Thread Studio's package manager, download the Titan Board resource package, create a new project, and compile it.

After compilation, connect the development board's USB-DBG interface to the PC and download the firmware to the development board.

## Run Effect

Press the reset button to restart the development board, enter the `alarm_sample` command to run the alarm clock example, you can see the following message printed on the board:

![image-20250814165115208](figures/image-20250814165115208.png)

## Extension: RTC Operation During Power Loss

When the main power supply of the board is disconnected, if you want the RTC to keep running during power loss, you need to connect an external power source to the **VBAT** pin. Note that when VBAT supplies power to the RTC, only the **Calendar counter** will continue to run — other RTC functions will not be available. Below is a reference code example:

**ps:** If the RTC is expected to run during power loss, make sure that `rtc_init` is only initialized **once**. Afterwards, you can use `rtc_get` to obtain the current time.

```c
#define RTC_YEAR_SET 2025
#define RTC_MON_SET  8
#define RTC_MDAY_SET 5

#define RTC_WDAY_SET (RTC_YEAR_SET-2000 \
                  + ((RTC_YEAR_SET-2000)/4) \
                  - 35 + (26*(RTC_MON_SET+1))/10 \
                  + RTC_MDAY_SET -1 )%7

#define RTC_HOUR_SET 12
#define RTC_SEC_SET 0
#define RTC_MIN_SET 0

void rtc_get()
{
    rtc_time_t get_time;
    R_RTC_CalendarTimeGet(g_rtc.p_ctrl, &get_time);
    rt_kprintf ("%d-%d-%d-%d:%d:%d\r\n", get_time.tm_year + 1900, get_time.tm_mon + 1, get_time.tm_mday,
             get_time.tm_hour, get_time.tm_min, get_time.tm_sec);
}
MSH_CMD_EXPORT(rtc_get, rtc_get);

void rtc_init(void)
{
   rtc_time_t set_time =
   {
     .tm_min = RTC_MIN_SET,
     .tm_hour = RTC_HOUR_SET,
     .tm_mday = RTC_MDAY_SET,
     .tm_wday = RTC_WDAY_SET,
     .tm_mon = RTC_MON_SET - 1,
     .tm_year = RTC_YEAR_SET-1900,
   };

   R_RTC_Open (g_rtc.p_ctrl, g_rtc.p_cfg);

   R_RTC_CalendarTimeSet (g_rtc.p_ctrl, &set_time);
}
MSH_CMD_EXPORT(rtc_init, rtc_init);
```
