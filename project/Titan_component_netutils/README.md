#### Connect to Wi-Fi

After the program runs, it will enter the MSH command line and wait for the user to configure the device to connect to the network. Use the MSH command "wifi join ssid password" to configure the network, as shown below:

```shell
msh />wifi join ssid_test password
join ssid:ssid_test
[I/WLAN.mgnt] wifi connect success ssid:ssid_test
msh />[I/WLAN.lwip] Got IP address : 192.168.173.8
```

#### Ping tool

Ping is a network diagnostic tool used to test whether data packets can reach a specific host via the IP protocol. It estimates the packet loss rate (packet loss ratio) between the host and the device and the round-trip time of the packets.

* Ping domain

```shell
msh />ping www.rt-thread.org
ping: not found specified netif, using default netdev w0.
60 bytes from 120.222.223.251 icmp_seq=1 ttl=48 time=76 ms
60 bytes from 120.222.223.251 icmp_seq=2 ttl=48 time=54 ms
60 bytes from 120.222.223.251 icmp_seq=3 ttl=48 time=74 ms
60 bytes from 120.222.223.251 icmp_seq=4 ttl=48 time=74 ms

--- 120.222.223.251 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
minimum = 54ms, maximum = 76ms, average = 69ms
msh />
```

* Ping IP

```shell
msh />ping 192.168.173.247
ping: not found specified netif, using default netdev w0.
60 bytes from 192.168.173.247 icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=42 ms
60 bytes from 192.168.173.247 icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=44 ms
60 bytes from 192.168.173.247 icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=24 ms
60 bytes from 192.168.173.247 icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=24 ms

--- 192.168.173.247 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
minimum = 24ms, maximum = 44ms, average = 33ms
msh />
```

#### **NTP** tool

NTP is the Network Time Protocol, which is a protocol used to synchronize the times of various computers in a network. The netutils software package implements the NTP client. After connecting to the network, one can obtain the current UTC time and update it to the RTC.

The effect of the MSH command is as follows:

```shell
msh />ntp_sync
[I/ntp] Get local time from NTP server: Mon Sep  1 15:15:35 2025
msh />
```

#### **TFTP** tool

**TFTP** (**Trivial File Transfer Protocol**, Simple File Transfer Protocol) is one of the protocols within the TCP/IP suite, used for transferring files between a client and a server. 
A simple protocol for file transfer between the server and the client, providing a straightforward and low-cost file transfer service. The port number is 69, which is different from the traditional one. 
The FTP protocol is much more lightweight and is suitable for use in small embedded products. 
The preparation for the TFTP tool requires the following two steps:

* The installation file for the TFTP client is located at **packages/netutils/tools/Tftpd64-4.60-setup.exe**. Before using TFTP, please install this software first.

* To start the TFTP server before transferring files, you need to use the Finsh/MSH commands on RT-Thread to initiate the TFTP server. The general effect is as follows:

```shell
msh />tftp -s
tftp server start!
msh />
```

* Connect to the RT-Thread operating system and send files

1. Open the newly installed Tftpd64 software and follow the steps below to configure it:选择 Tftp Client ；

2. In the "Server interfaces" dropdown box, make sure to select the network card that is in the same network segment as RT-Thread.

3. Enter the IP address of the TFTP server. You can view it using the ifconfig command in the MSH of RT-Thread.

4. Enter the port number of the TFTP server. The default is 69.

5. Select the file to be sent. "Remote File" is the path (including the file name) where the file is saved on the server side. The options support both relative and absolute paths. Since RT-Thread by default enables the DFS_USING_WORKDIR option, at this time the relative path is based on the current directory entered by MSH. Therefore, when using a relative path, be sure to switch the directory in advance.

6. Just click the "Put" button.

**Note:** If DFS_USING_WORKDIR is not enabled and the Remote File is empty, the file will be saved in the root directory.

![image-20250901150824232](figures/image-20250901150824232.png)

View the files sent by PC in MSH:

```shell
msh />ls
Directory /:
test.txt            16
msh />cat test.txt
Hello RT-Thread!
msh />
```

* Retrieve the file from RT-Thread

First, create a text file in the root directory and enter the content "Hello!" 。

```shell
msh />echo "Hello!" test1.txt
msh />cat test1.txt
Hello!
msh />
```

1. In the Tftpd64 software, enter the path (including the file name) of the file to be received and saved. 

2. Remote File is the file path (including the file name) that the server is waiting to receive back. The option supports both relative and absolute paths. Since RT-Thread by default enables the DFS_USING_WORKDIR option, at this time, the relative path is based on the current directory entered by Finsh/MSH. Therefore, when using a relative path, be sure to switch the directory in advance.

3. Just click the "Get" button. As shown below, save "/test1.txt" to the local disk. Here, an absolute path is used.

#### Telnet tool

Telnet is a TCP-based remote terminal protocol used for remotely logging into the command line interface of devices over a network. Through Telnet, one can remotely access the command line of the development board from a PC, enabling debugging, monitoring, and control. To use the Finsh/MSH commands to start the telnet service on RT-Thread, the general effect is as follows:

```shell
msh />telnet_server
Telnet server start successfully
msh />telnet: waiting for connection
```

Next, use the remote connection tool to connect to the development board.

![image-20250901155545520](figures/image-20250901155545520.png)

After the connection is successful, you can remotely control the development board.

```shell
