## Introduction

This example demonstrates how to use the **Ethernet interface** on the **Titan Board** with the **RT-Thread Ethernet driver framework** to implement network connectivity.

Main features include:

- Initialization of RA8 Ethernet hardware
- Configuration of IP address, subnet mask, and gateway
- Sending and receiving Ethernet frames
- Integration with RT-Thread’s `netdev` framework for unified network device management
- Support for high-speed data transfer using DMA and interrupts

## Ethernet Introduction

### 1. Overview

**Ethernet** is the most widely used Local Area Network (LAN) technology. It was first proposed by Xerox PARC in the 1970s and later standardized by IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has the following characteristics:

- **Data Transmission Method**: Packet-based communication using **frames**, physically transmitted over twisted pair cables, fiber optics, or wireless media.
- **Topology**: Traditional Ethernet used bus or star topologies; modern Ethernet primarily adopts star and tree topologies.
- **Protocol Layer**: Operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.

### 2. Ethernet Frame Structure

Ethernet uses **frames** as the unit of data transmission. An Ethernet frame consists of the following fields:

| Field                       | Length        | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Preamble                    | 7 bytes       | Used for frame synchronization            |
| Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) | 1 byte        | Frame start indicator (10101011)          |
| Destination MAC Address     | 6 bytes       | Receiver hardware address                 |
| Source MAC Address          | 6 bytes       | Sender hardware address                   |
| Type/Length                 | 2 bytes       | Upper layer protocol type or frame length |
| Payload                     | 46–1500 bytes | Upper layer data (e.g., IP packet)        |
| CRC                         | 4 bytes       | Cyclic Redundancy Check for integrity     |

> **Minimum Frame Length**: 64 bytes
>  **Maximum Frame Length**: 1518 bytes (without VLAN tag)

### 3. Ethernet Physical Layer and Speed

Ethernet supports multiple speeds and physical media standards:

| Standard           | Speed       | Medium       | Feature                         |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 10BASE-T           | 10 Mbps     | Twisted pair | Original Ethernet standard      |
| 100BASE-TX         | 100 Mbps    | Twisted pair | Fast Ethernet                   |
| 1000BASE-T         | 1 Gbps      | Twisted pair | Gigabit Ethernet                |
| 10GBASE-T          | 10 Gbps     | Twisted pair | 10G Ethernet                    |
| 10GBASE-SR         | 10 Gbps     | Fiber        | Short-range fiber transmission  |
| 40GBASE / 100GBASE | 40/100 Gbps | Fiber        | High-speed data center Ethernet |

- **BASE-T**: Twisted pair transmission
- **BASE-SX / LX / SR**: Fiber optic transmission

### 4. Ethernet Access Control

Ethernet traditionally uses **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**:

1. **Carrier Sense**: Listen to the channel before transmitting.
2. **Multiple Access**: All nodes share the same channel.
3. **Collision Detection**: If a collision occurs, nodes stop transmitting and retry after a random delay.

> Note: Modern switch-based Ethernet typically operates in **full-duplex**, so CSMA/CD is no longer used.

### 5. VLAN and Ethernet Extensions

- **VLAN (Virtual LAN)**: Defined by IEEE 802.1Q to logically segment networks, improving security and manageability.
- **VLAN Tagged Frame Structure**:

| Field   | Length        | Description                     |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| TPID    | 2 bytes       | Ethernet type identifier 0x8100 |
| TCI     | 2 bytes       | VLAN ID and priority            |
| Payload | 46–1500 bytes | Upper layer data                |
| CRC     | 4 bytes       | Frame check                     |

- **QoS Support**: The PCP field in VLAN tags can indicate priority levels.

### 6. Ethernet Frame Types

1. **Unicast**: Frame destined for a single MAC address.
2. **Broadcast**: Frame destined for all nodes (MAC = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF).
3. **Multicast**: Frame destined for a group of nodes.

### 7. Ethernet Trends

1. **Higher Speeds**: From 10 Mbps → 100 Mbps → 1 Gbps → 10/40/100 Gbps.
2. **Industrial Ethernet**: Supports real-time control protocols like EtherCAT, Profinet, TSN.
3. **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Transmits data and power over the same cable.
4. **Full-Duplex Switch Networks**: Eliminates collisions and improves bandwidth utilization.
5. **Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)**: Provides deterministic latency for industrial automation and automotive networks.
